Okay Guys, here is what ya wanna know (We always know what you want !)

BDFLI.EXE has four Commandline-Parameters:

      'BDFLI.EXE PicDir PicNum DriverDir BreakKey'

- 'PicDir' is the directory the BMP - pictures are in.
- 'PicNum' is the number of total pictures.
- 'DriverDir' is the directory where the EGAVGA.BGI can be found.
- 'BreakKey' is the key you can stop the show with. When nothing is entered
  here, you can not stop the show !
 
Enter parameters without '/' or '-' !!!
If you want to enter the current directory, enter '.\' and not nothing !!!


The .BMP files have to be named as follows:

            01.BMP
            02.BMP
            03.BMP
            .
            .
            .
            10.BMP
            11.BMP
            12.BMP

            ... etc.

They should also have the same size (But it's not necessary) !
